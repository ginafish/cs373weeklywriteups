            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile phones have come a long way.  They used to be bulky, expensive, have a short lifespan, and not have much storage.  They had "special" keys like "Pwr", "Snd", "Clr", and os on.  It would run on an analog "1G" network, and is the only one that only provides voice features (later networks go digital and then offer internet connections).  There was also no security as a result.  Later networks offer some security with SIM cards.

            <h2>Mobile OS</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile OS market has gone from iOS + Symbian being dominant to Android followed by iOS.  iPhone was the first smartphone - closed source and proprietary, as Apple likes to do.  Apple has very strongly integrated services and software.  Windows Phone also closed source, proprietary, and pushed integration.  One major difference was that Microsoft let many different manufacturers make Windows phones.  Android was developed by Android Inc by Danger before being bought by Google.  Open Handset Alliance (carriers and manufacturers) supported Android.  Android is FOSS, though a lot of the Google applications on it are not, and it's very reliant on Google services.  Android ecosystem is very fragmented due to manufacturers and carriers having their own forks that struggle to integrate Android changes and security updates.  Firefox OS, Tizen, and Ubuntu Torch are examples of fully open source mobile OS - Linux!  Lots of IoT devices run Tizen.

            <h3>Apps</h3>
            <p>
                Android has an automated review process, while iOS and Windows have manual ones.  iOS is the most expensive (requiring $99 a year...), while Android charges a flat $25.  Android also allows for self-signed or verisign certificates.

            <h2>Bypassing Security</h2>
            <p>
                In iOS, you "jailbreak" to let you run any software or code and open security backdoors as well as unlocking carrier locks.  Two types of jailbreaks: tethered and untethered.  There are a lot of desktop-based ways of jailbreaking your iPhone, and there are some that can exploit mobile browsers to jailbreak.

                In Android, you do rooting to try to get root privileges.  Once you have root privileges, you can use them to do privileged operations, and do basically anything you want to do.  You use exploits to get root.  Newer android versions have extra security enhancements.

            <h2>Malware Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                Genesis - Epoc.Fake was the first to be using Bluetooth and it pretended to format the hard drive. Next is Cabir which was actually distributed over Bluetooth and just ate up your battery life.

                2008-2010 "Calm before the storm" because there were new platforms but not very much malware.  Majority was SMS Trojans, but there was cross-platform mobile malware.  Symbian worm YXES was the first mobile botnet, spread through SMS.  SMS message contained URL that users clicked and downloaded.  It was signed with a valid digital certificate and made silent Internet communications.  It worked on spreading while disabling apps like File Explorer and encrypted URLs to try to hide.  Ikee was the first iOS malware, discovered in 2009.  Rather like today's ransomware, it exploited jailbroken iPhones and asked you to pay to remove it.  Not long after its discovery, a variant came out that changed your wallpaper to a Rickroll.  FakePlayer was the first Android malware, found in 2010.  It simply tried to be a media player application that would send a text to a premium phone number that you would then be charged for.  It was targeting Russian users and it is unknown how it was distributed, but wasn't through the Android Market (Google Play).  Tapsnake, found a few days later, was found in the Android Market, which pretended to be the Snake game and would send your GPS location to a server.

                2011-2012, "Malware Revolution" because there was an explosion in the number of malware variants.  One variation was one that would take real legitimate applications and then repackage them with malicious code inside.  Another, Droiddream, tried to root your device and then would install a bunch of other applications.  It had 50k - 200k installs over four days.  Used publically disclosed exploits to get root privileges.  Google's reaction was to suspend the malicious developers' accounts, remove the malware, and push an automatic tool to fix the exploits without any user intervention.  That tool was then used by malware authors to create more malware.
