            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile phones have come a long way.  They used to be bulky, expensive, have a short lifespan, and not have much storage.  They had "special" keys like "Pwr", "Snd", "Clr", and os on.  It would run on an analog "1G" network, and is the only one that only provides voice features (later networks go digital and then offer internet connections).  There was also no security as a result.  Later networks offer some security with SIM cards.

            <h2>Mobile OS</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile OS market has gone from iOS + Symbian being dominant to Android followed by iOS.  iPhone was the first smartphone - closed source and proprietary, as Apple likes to do.  Apple has very strongly integrated services and software.  Windows Phone also closed source, proprietary, and pushed integration.  One major difference was that Microsoft let many different manufacturers make Windows phones.  Android was developed by Android Inc by Danger before being bought by Google.  Open Handset Alliance (carriers and manufacturers) supported Android.  Android is FOSS, though a lot of the Google applications on it are not, and it's very reliant on Google services.  Android ecosystem is very fragmented due to manufacturers and carriers having their own forks that struggle to integrate Android changes and security updates.  Firefox OS, Tizen, and Ubuntu Torch are examples of fully open source mobile OS - Linux!  Lots of IoT devices run Tizen.

            <h3>Apps</h3>
            <p>
                Android has an automated review process, while iOS and Windows have manual ones.  iOS is the most expensive (requiring $99 a year...), while Android charges a flat $25.  Android also allows for self-signed or verisign certificates.
