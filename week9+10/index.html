            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile phones have come a long way.  They used to be bulky, expensive, have a short lifespan, and not have much storage.  They had "special" keys like "Pwr", "Snd", "Clr", and os on.  It would run on an analog "1G" network, and is the only one that only provides voice features (later networks go digital and then offer internet connections).  There was also no security as a result.  Later networks offer some security with SIM cards.

            <h2>Mobile OS</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile OS market has gone from iOS + Symbian being dominant to Android followed by iOS.  iPhone was the first smartphone - closed source and proprietary, as Apple likes to do.  Apple has very strongly integrated services and software.  Windows Phone also closed source, proprietary, and pushed integration.  One major difference was that Microsoft let many different manufacturers make Windows phones.  Android was developed by Android Inc by Danger before being bought by Google.  Open Handset Alliance (carriers and manufacturers) supported Android.  Android is FOSS, though a lot of the Google applications on it are not, and it's very reliant on Google services.  Android ecosystem is very fragmented due to manufacturers and carriers having their own forks that struggle to integrate Android changes and security updates.  Firefox OS, Tizen, and Ubuntu Torch are examples of fully open source mobile OS - Linux!  Lots of IoT devices run Tizen.

            <h3>Apps</h3>
            <p>
                Android has an automated review process, while iOS and Windows have manual ones.  iOS is the most expensive (requiring $99 a year...), while Android charges a flat $25.  Android also allows for self-signed or verisign certificates.

            <h2>Bypassing Security</h2>
            <p>
                In iOS, you "jailbreak" to let you run any software or code and open security backdoors as well as unlocking carrier locks.  Two types of jailbreaks: tethered and untethered.  There are a lot of desktop-based ways of jailbreaking your iPhone, and there are some that can exploit mobile browsers to jailbreak.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Android, you do rooting to try to get root privileges.  Once you have root privileges, you can use them to do privileged operations, and do basically anything you want to do.  You use exploits to get root.  Newer android versions have extra security enhancements.

            <h2>Malware Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                Genesis - Epoc.Fake was the first to be using Bluetooth and it pretended to format the hard drive. Next is Cabir which was actually distributed over Bluetooth and just ate up your battery life.
            </p>
            <p>
                2008-2010 "Calm before the storm" because there were new platforms but not very much malware.  Majority was SMS Trojans, but there was cross-platform mobile malware.  Symbian worm YXES was the first mobile botnet, spread through SMS.  SMS message contained URL that users clicked and downloaded.  It was signed with a valid digital certificate and made silent Internet communications.  It worked on spreading while disabling apps like File Explorer and encrypted URLs to try to hide.  Ikee was the first iOS malware, discovered in 2009.  Rather like today's ransomware, it exploited jailbroken iPhones and asked you to pay to remove it.  Not long after its discovery, a variant came out that changed your wallpaper to a Rickroll.  FakePlayer was the first Android malware, found in 2010.  It simply tried to be a media player application that would send a text to a premium phone number that you would then be charged for.  It was targeting Russian users and it is unknown how it was distributed, but wasn't through the Android Market (Google Play).  Tapsnake, found a few days later, was found in the Android Market, which pretended to be the Snake game and would send your GPS location to a server.
            </p>
            <p>
                2011-2012, "Malware Revolution" because there was an explosion in the number of malware variants.  One variation was one that would take real legitimate applications and then repackage them with malicious code inside.  Another, Droiddream, tried to root your device and then would install a bunch of other applications.  It had 50k - 200k installs over four days.  Used publically disclosed exploits to get root privileges.  Google's reaction was to suspend the malicious developers' accounts, remove the malware, and push an automatic tool to fix the exploits without any user intervention.  That tool was then used by malware authors to create more malware.

            <h2>Android Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>
                Architecture: applications, application framework, libraries | android runtime, linux kernel.  Dalvik VM is a VM software for Android pre-5.0 (at the time of the lecture).  The Android after version 4.4 has Ahead-of-time compilation, better garbage collection, and improvements for development and debugging.  ART, which has these things, slowly replaced Dalvik from 4.4 to 5.0.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parts of an Android application: Activities (UIs, each is a single screen), Services (parts taht run in the background without a UI), Broadcast Receivers (system-wide announcements like like the device finishing booting up), Content Providers (shared app data, like contacts, which may have sensitive info and isn't commonly used by malware authors).  All apps are sandboxed from each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interprocess communication: applications talking to each other.  Content providers, like photos and databases, expose data.  Intents send messages between apps.  Intents can be explicit or implicit, with the former being for things like starting services, and the latter being for data administration privilege requests.  Binders allow processes to call things in others' processes.  All other ways aren't officially Google-approved, but some are Unix-type, like process Signals, pipes, sockets, message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.  Non-official methods may not work as well due to Android's app sandboxing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Permissions: process restrictions.  At the time of the lecture, Android had static permissions where they are requested on install and not when the application is ran.  Permissions needed would need to be declared in Manifests, as by default they have none.  Permission levels range from normal to SignatureOrSystem, where the lowest requires no approval, while the highest only works if it's a signed app in the system image.  Dangerous requires user approval, and Signature requires two apps' certificates to match.
            </p>
            <p>
                Manifest declares needed permissions, minimum API level required, declares the components of the app, and any necessary hardware or software features (like the camera or microphone).

            <h2>Malware and Public Exploits</h2>
            <p>
                Exploid - exploits a vuln that was recorded as patched in 2009.  Turned out it was fixed in Linux for desktop but not Android.  The exploit exploited udev, the device manager for the kernel that handles user space.  Android moved udev into the init daemon from its own executable, which is a daemon that runs in userland with root privileges.  Android udev then would not make sure that uevent messages actually came from the kernel....  The exploit would spoof kernel messages and send them to userland for udev to pick up.  Create a real event for udev, and then it will try to do whatever you told it to do (like launching sh with root privileges).
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratc, another expliot, would exploit forking and the Android Debug Bridge to get root privileges.

            <h2>Payload Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Elf binaries can be used by good actors and bad.  You can use a hex editor to check if 75 45 4C (ELF) is in a file, but it might be encrypted sometimes.  Often binary code is hidden inside images.  You can execute the ELF payload through loading it as a library or executing it through a shell, though there are lots and lots of other ways.  You can do static analysis with the ARM disassembler, which gives you assembly code, or the decompiler, which gives you code that is basically a step above assembly.  Other disassemblers include IDA Pro, ODA, and Hex-Rays, though the first and last are very expensive.  You can also run debuggers like gdb, gdbserver and gdbclient.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Android Banking Trojans</h2>
            <p>
                Steal your 2FA, steal your credentials, give those hackers their money... is what we want to avoid.  2Fa involves combinations of things like PINs, passwords, patterns, credit cards, tokens, and fingerprints to determine if an application should grant you access or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                The early banking trojans for mobile were components intended to work with their PC versions.  They would try to get your credentials by infecting, using a fake credential request page, getting you to input your credentials in the fake page, ask you to install the Android "security app", and then use the installed Android malware to get the 2nd factor.
