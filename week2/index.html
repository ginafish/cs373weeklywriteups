            <h2>Forensics Basics</h2>
            <p>
                The most fundamental parts of computer forensics are making sure 
                Key things: can you replicate it?  Can you explain it?
                Yes you can analyze memory dumps!  It's a core step.
                Only thing you are proving is what happened on the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                When do you do forensic investigations?  You do investigations in cases of fraud, intellectual property theft, 
                hacker intrusions or data breaches, and more unnerving crimes like child exploitation and trafficking.  Memory 
                dumps are extremely useful for investigations, and there are other other tools like physically freezing the 
                system that can be used to avoid data loss.  With no data, there isn't anything to investigate.  Memory dumps 
                should be a core step of investigations.

                Forensics Steps: Evidence acquisition, Investigation and analysis, Reporting results
                Three categories: Life forensics, Post-mortem based forensics (memory/disk), Network based forensics
                Can use md5 checksums to compare to databases to check if child porn
                Have to learn how to explain to judges in a way they understand
                Forensics Nutshell: identify evidence, preserve evidence, analyze evidence, present results
                Four principles: minimize data loss, record everything, analyze all data collected, report findings
                May need to present to a court of law
                First thing you always do: record your time and the system time
                Might be on a corporate time sync server, and be 5+ minutes off
                Difficult things that might be useful: car gps!

            <h2>Evidence (lesson 1 part 3)</h2>
            <h3>What is evidence?</h3>
            <p>Given how forensics is used in a court of law, it is important to understand what is evidence.
                Evidence is
                Evidence can be found from all kinds of levels: your network, operating system, applications that you use,
                    peripherals, USB drives, and other human testimony.  Just keep in mind - just because it's evidence doesn't
                    mean that it is admissable evidence, which is evidence that a court can accept.
