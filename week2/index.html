            <h2>Forensics Basics</h2>
            <p>
                The most fundamental parts of computer forensics are making sure that you can 1. replicate it 2. explain it.  
                Rather like tech support, part of what you do is explaining to non-technical people and those who simply don't 
                have as much knowledge as you do what is going on and why it should not be that way.  Even more so for computer 
                forensicists, because they may have to go up to a judge or jury in a court case, or explain a company breach to 
                a PR person, and make sure that non-technical people understand well enough to themselves communicate what 
                happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                When do you do forensic investigations?  You do investigations in cases of fraud, intellectual property theft, 
                hacker intrusions or data breaches, and more unnerving crimes like child exploitation and trafficking.    
            </p>
            <p>
                Memory dumps are extremely useful for investigations, and there are other other tools like physically freezing the 
                system that can be used to avoid data loss.  With no data, there isn't anything to investigate.  Memory dumps 
                should be a core step of investigations.  One rather interesting tactic when investigating child exploitation 
                is that there are databases that hold hashes of images, and you could compare the hashes to hashes of files that 
                you have so you don't have to view the horrifying images yourself.  Additionally, the first thing that you should 
                always do when given a device is to record both your time and the system time.  The system time might be way off, 
                and you may need to rebuild a chronological sequence of the events.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a forensicist, your goal is to prove what happened on the device that you are investigating.  You follow four 
                basic steps: identifying and acquiring evidence, preserving the evidence, investigating and analyzing the evidence, 
                and presenting your results.  The lecturer mentioned that reports would almost always be read over by colleagues, and 
                edited to be as best as possible before presented.  Forensics has four principles: minimizing data loss, recording everything, 
                analyzing all data collected, and always reporting findings.  The three main categories are life forensics, post-mortem 
                based forensics (such as investigating memory on main memory or a disk), and network based forensics.
            </p>

            <h2>Evidence</h2>
            <h3>What is evidence?</h3>
            <p>
                Given how forensics is used in a court of law, it is important to understand what is evidence.
                Evidence is simply anything that can be used to prove or disprove a fact.  It is used to build proof 
                    and not to pass judgement.
                Evidence can be found from all kinds of levels: your network, operating system, applications that you use,
                    peripherals, USB drives, and other human testimony.  Just keep in mind - just because it's evidence doesn't
                    mean that it is admissable evidence, which is evidence that a court can accept.
                You can find evidence in all kinds of places your computer.  Registry, log files, the file system, your memory... 
                    all kinds of places that you might not think of normally in normal use.
                Most importantly, you need to find evidence to prove something in multiple ways one cohesive conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can be incredibly hard to dig through as much data as there can be, especially now that larger hard drives are 
                    getting more common.  For example, child exploiter might have multiple 8TB harddrives of video or images.
            </p>

            <h3>Gathering and Preserving Evidence</h3>
            <p>
                Your primary goal is to preserve the data that you have.  A couple of ways to ensure this are to create a bit-image 
                    copy for analysis or creating a hash of the disk and its partitions.  Hashes can be extremely useful, and 
                    help you ensure that no data is lost or changed.  The original harddrive should still be kept safe even 
                    after you get the checksum.
            </p>
            <p>
                One technique that can be used for getting through all of the data if you have a large or multiple harddrives to 
                    investigate is using a whitelisted checksum - basically, using checksums to identify what you know isn't 
                    malicious so that you can filter out what you know is good and only look through what you aren't sure of.  
                    If their harddrive is encrypted, you might be able to either get the key from the owner, or get what you 
                    need from memory dumps.
            </p>
            <p>
                SSDs can be special, and you can be asked to do forensics on devices like GPSes.  Additionally, there can be lines 
                    in what you can investigate.  If you find someone's email account login, for example, you would need to get 
                    permission from a judge before you log into their account, even if you can't find anything on their system.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Incidence Response</h2>
            <p>
                A major part of incident response is evaluation.  Teams often can be ad hoc, and be subject matter experts pulled 
                    together and asked to investigate.  Not only do you need to find what happened, but how to fix the incident 
                    and prevent it from spreading.  You have to take reponsibility for what you do, which could be things like 
                    shutting down entire servers.  Beware of panicked management.  You also need to make sure that you have the 
                    access that you need to investigate.  If you don't find what you're looking for where you look, look elsewhere.
                    Logs can quite vary from one system to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Incidents typically follow a few steps.  Reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, 
                    command and control, and then actions on objectives.  Attackers look to figure out how to break into your 
                    system, figure out how, deliver it to you, then try to take over your system so that they can do what they 
                    wanted to do.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The cycle of investigation has a few steps before the cycle.  Verification, system description, and evidence acquisition 
                    before the cycle of timeline analysis, media analysist, string or byte search, data recovery, and reporting your 
                    analysis.
            </p>

            <h2>Tools!</h2>
            <p>
                Locard's exchange principle states that there is always a transfer of material from one thing to another when they come into 
                    contact.  Basically, you cannot interact with something without affecting it, which means a lot when investigating 
                    forensics.  Even taking a system snapshot can leave evidence.  That means you need to keep in mind that your investigation 
                    will leave traces that will remain, and that you need to record it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, you may not be able to do anything other than pull the plug, but it comes with risks, including destroying data.  
                    Windows does have a pagefile.sys that can be examined, and there are hibernation files.
                    One thing that you should always do is unplug the network cable or get the port blocked.  Otherwise, an attacker might 
                    remain connected.  To minimize data risk, you want to examine things in the order of volatitity from the top down.
                <dl>
                    <dt>Order of volatility</dt>
                    <dd>System memory</dd>
                    <dd>Temporary File systems (like a swapfile or paging file)</dd>
                    <dd>Process table and network connections (specifics can be dumped)</dd>
                    <dd>Network routing information and ARP cache</dd>
                    <dd>Forensic disk examination</dd>
                    <dd>Remote logging and monitoring</dd>
                    <dd>Physical configuration and network topology</dd>
                    <dd>Backups</dd>
                </dl>
                You should not be limited to the list, as you might always be able to find more.  Always get the volatile data before you 
                    start on non-volatitle things like logs, registry, executables, or relevant files.
            </p>
            <p>
                When doing investigation, don't install your tools on what you are investigating!  Evidence and backups should not be written 
                    to the suspect device.  AccessData and FastDump are tools for doing memory dumps.  Network shares are good places to save 
                    to.  You can mount disk image backups to analyze them, and do it in read only mode.
            </p>

            <h2>Memory is Wonderful</h2>
            <p>
                You can get crazy amounts of data from the main memory.  Volatility is a great tool for getting memory dumps, and Yara is a 
                    great Volatility addon for finding malware on memory.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Places to look</h2>
            <p>
                Windows will log just about everything that happens to it in the Registry.  Regripper can be used for analyzing it, but you can 
                    also just use the standard Registry Editor.  The top 5 folders are called hives, or root keys, and only HKEY_USERS (HKU) and 
                    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) are real folders, as the other three are shortcuts.  The folders under the root keys are subkeys, 
                    and they contain collections of values, which have a name and a data value.  Malware likes to use the Registry because it 
                    can cause shenanigans like the malware being reran after reboots.  The registry also saves passwords and visited urls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you find one thing, use it to find the next.  Try to correlate time stamps to build a timeline and get a big picture of the 
                    malware.  The master file table is really useful, as it tracks file creation and edits.  Volatility, the master file table, 
                    and Reg-Ripper are good tools for building timelines.
