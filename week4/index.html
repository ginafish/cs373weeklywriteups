                Most of the exploits out in the world are Windows based, so we're going to focus on Windows.  Hacking involves controlling programs in a way other than originally intended.  For example, when asked to go left or right, going straight or backwards.  Your goal is to think outside of the box to do what the developer didn't think about.  You can find "bugs" that alter the behavior of the program or take advantage of a misconfigured or poor programming decision (ex: weak password).  Hacking is a very serious thing now (think militarized cyber armies), so you have to be safe and ethical when learning how.  Also, if you ever want to cash in on a bug bounty, don't go to the company but go directly to the bug bounty team, or you may get lawyers threatening to sue you.  11:41
