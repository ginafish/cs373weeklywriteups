                Basics of Malware and the Industry
            </h3>
            <p>
                Malware has continuously evolved over the years, with antivirus companies to keep up and, if possible, get ahead.  Antivirus vendors get flooded with malware samples, and they have to work to prevent false positives while making sure that customers are protected.  Additionally, they have to keep updates small enough and infrequent enough that customers will continue to use antivirus.  Malware comes in varying different types, from rootkits and bootkits, which can create hidden partitions on disks, to PUPs (Potentially Unwanted Programs) and Adware.

            <h3>
                Cooperation in the Industry
            </h3>
            <p>
                One of the rather interesting topics in the lectures was on how much cooperation goes on in the antivirus industry.  Not only do antivirus companies work together to take down botnets, they work with local governments.  There wasn't much mention in the lecture of them helping each other figure out how to solve malware, but sharing malware samples is a common practice.  There is a common industry practice of password protecting .zip archives with 'infected' as the password.

            <p>
                Of course, not only is there cooperation between antivirus companies, but the malware writers themselves.  Malware writers are known for taking code from other malware writers and using it in their own malware.  That cooperation can often turn into rivalry, with malware writers threatening to reveal each others' secrets.

            <h3>Tools</h3>

            <h4>
                Flypaper
            </h4>
            <p>
                Flypaper helps block TCP/IP network connections and tries to keep processes from exiting.

            <h4>
                Fakenet
            </h4>
            <p>
                Fakenet listens to network traffic and intercepts requests.  Requests get intercepted with a generic Fakenet Help page.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Process Monitor
            </h4>
            <p>
                Process Monitor logs system events, such as registry checks and file creations, as well as the processes that executed the tasks.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Process Explorer
            </h4>
            <p>
                Process Explorer is basically Task Manager with some added stuff, including process trees and parent processes.  There is added integration that allows you to submit processes to Virustotal.com to check for infections.
            </p>

            <h4>
                AntiSpy
            </h4>
            <p>
                AntiSpy also shows lists of processes, but shows additional information like process ids and parent pids.  It shows the file path locations of the processes that are running.  There is a lot more like a built in registry viewer, file explorer, listed programs that are set to automatically start on boot, network information, and more.
