                Basics of Malware and the Industry
            </h3>
            <p>
                Malware has continuously evolved over the years, with antivirus companies to keep up and, if possible, get ahead.  Antivirus vendors get flooded with malware samples, and they have to work to prevent false positives while making sure that customers are protected.  Additionally, they have to keep updates small enough and infrequent enough that customers will continue to use antivirus.  Malware comes in varying different types, from rootkits and bootkits, which can create hidden partitions on disks, to PUPs (Potentially Unwanted Programs) and Adware.

                Cooperation in the Industry
            </h3>
            <p>
                One of the rather interesting topics in the lectures was on how much cooperation goes on in the antivirus industry.  Not only do antivirus companies work together to take down botnets, they work with local governments.  There wasn't much mention in the lecture of them helping each other figure out how to solve malware, but sharing malware samples is a common practice.

            <p>
                Of course, not only is there cooperation between antivirus companies, but the malware writers themselves.  Malware writers are known for taking code from other malware writers and using it in their own malware.
